# HOW IT WORKS
This fitness app has four main pages: Home, Muscles, Exercises, and Workouts.

The Home page serves as the main navigation hub for the app, allowing users to access the other pages and register if they are not logged in.

The Muscles page displays a comprehensive list of all the muscles that can be trained, providing users with a clear overview of the available training options.

The Exercises page displays a selection of 10 exercises for each muscle group, curated by the app's admin. Users can also create, read, update, and delete their own custom exercises based on specific muscle groups.

The Workouts page allows users to view existing workouts and create their own custom workouts based on the exercises available in the app. Users can also manage their existing workouts, including editing, deleting, and creating new ones.

Overall, this fitness app offers a range of features and options to help users tailor their workout routines and achieve their fitness goals.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
``` 
npm install 
```
Create an .env file with the following lines:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5005/api
REACT_APP_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:5005/auth
```

then, you can run:
``` 
npm start 
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

```
npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
